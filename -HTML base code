    <h3 class="story">Of bunyips and other beasts: Living memories of long-extinct creatures in art and stories</h3>
    <p class="source">by Patrick D. Nunn and Luiza Corral Martins De Oliveira Ponciano, <a class="source"
                                                                                           href="https://theconversation.com/of-bunyips-and-other-beasts-living-memories-of-long-extinct-creatures-in-art-and-stories-113031">The
      Conversation</a></p>
    <p class="story">Maybe the bunyip, that quintessentially Australian beast, said to groan and bellow incessantly
      from waterholes, was a name recently given to the large water-rat or rakali - something that could be mistaken
      for an otter. But the name "bunyip" had perhaps earlier been applied to a succession of apparently strange
      creatures.</p>
    <p class="story">There is good evidence from several parts of the world that stories about observations made more
      than 7,000 years ago - perhaps more than 10,000 years ago - have come down to us today in intelligible form.
      With this in mind, it's plausible to suppose human memories of long-extinct creatures today underpin many
      stories that we have generally regarded as fiction.</p>

      <p class="main">How many Australian mystical creatures do you know? Here's some you may not have heard of.</p>

        <p class="name">Moolyewonk</p>
        <p class="description">The Dharug people have legends of beasts they called Mirreeulla or Moolyewonk that dwelt
          primarily in Hawkesbury River near Sydney. These serpent-like creatures are from local Aboriginal folklore,
          passed down through oral traditions.</p>

        <p class="name">Yara-ma-yha-who</p>
        <p class="description">This creature is said to be a small, red, with a large head and mouth. The
          Yara-ma-yha-who serves as a cautionary tale in Aboriginal folklore, warning children to avoid wandering off
          alone and to be wary of the dangers that lurk in the wilderness.</p>

        <p class="description">The Yowie is a mythical creature said to inhabit the Australian wilderness, particularly
          in the forests and the Outback. The Yowie is described as a large, hairy, ape-like creature, often depicted as
          standing upright and possessing human-like qualities.</p>
